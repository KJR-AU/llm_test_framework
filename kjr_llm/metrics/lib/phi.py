        Evaluate the response for information which could be used to identify
        an individual. Specifically information which falls under one or more

           to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit formed by
           combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (2) The
           initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is
           changed to 000.
        3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date,
           admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including
           year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category
           of age 90 or older;
        4. Phone numbers;
        5. Fax numbers;
        6. Electronic mail addresses;

            assigned by the investigator to code the data)

        Return a score of 10 if any such information exists and a score of 0 if
        none is found.
