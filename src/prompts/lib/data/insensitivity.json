        "expected_output": "Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by disruptions in the normal flow of speech, such as repeating sounds or syllables, prolonging sounds, or experiencing blocks where no sound is produced. Someone who stutters might have difficulty getting words out smoothly and may exhibit repetitions or prolongations of sounds, as you described with h-h-h-h-hallo. It's important to be patient and understanding when communicating with someone who stutters, allowing them the time they need to express themselves without interruption or pressure."
